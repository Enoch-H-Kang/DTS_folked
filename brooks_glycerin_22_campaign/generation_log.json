      "prompt": "**Ad Image #1 Prompt:**\n\n**photograph, surreal tech-conceptual product shot** // A single Brooks Glycerin 22 shoe (men's fresh blue/white colorway) floats majestically at the center of a minimalist, futuristic innovation lab. The atmosphere is **modern and kinetic**.\n\n**Scene & Composition:** The shoe is deconstructed mid-air; the main, fully assembled shoe is the hero, while its core components—the outsole, knit upper, and midsole—levitate around it in an exploded view. The composition uses a strong diagonal axis, guiding the eye from the separated components to the complete shoe.\n\n**Technical Feature Focus:** Emanating from the floating midsole piece is a glowing, interactive hologram that magnifies its internal structure, revealing the **DNA Tuned Cushioning** as a vibrant, 3D matrix of nitrogen-infused, dual-size cells in luminous cyan and white. The texture of the **engineered double jacquard knit upper** is hyper-detailed on its own floating segment, with light catching individual threads.\n\n**Location & Time:** The scene is set at **golden hour**. Warm, dramatic sunset light streams through a massive floor-to-ceiling window, revealing a soft-focus, modern city skyline in the background.\n\n**Lighting & Color:** A dynamic interplay of light: the warm, golden sun from the window creates sharp highlights and long, soft shadows on the polished concrete floor, contrasted by the cool, ethereal blue glow from the holographic cell display. The color palette is dominated by Brooks' signature blue, clean architectural whites, and deep greys, all punctuated by the warm gold and cyan accents.\n\n**Camera & Technique:** **Low-angle shot** using a **35mm lens** to give the shoe a heroic presence. The aperture is set to **f/2.8**, creating a shallow depth of field where the central shoe and holographic midsole are in tack-sharp focus, while the background lab environment and city are beautifully blurred. A slight motion blur is applied to the orbiting components to suggest slow, graceful movement.\n\n**Branding & Typography:** In the negative space of the dark, polished floor in the foreground, the brand name **\"BROOKS\"** is placed on the left and the tagline **\"THE ALL-NEW GLYCERIN 22\"** is on the right, both in a clean, elegant, all-caps sans-serif font. A subtle, out-of-focus Brooks logo is visible on a sleek monitor in the far background.\n\n**Negative Prompt:**\navoid: competing brand logos, text errors, distorted human anatomy, blurry main subject, low-resolution textures, plastic-looking materials, cluttered background.",

      "prompt": "**Ad Image #2 Prompt:**\n\nA surreal, artistic, ultra-detailed macro photograph of a single Brooks Glycerin 22 running shoe, captured in a minimalist studio setting.\n\n**Scene & Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is **chic and powerful**. The shoe rests on a dark, polished concrete floor that softly reflects a warm glow. Ethereal, semi-transparent, iridescent spheres and soft-edged geometric forms, representing the nitrogen-infused foam cells, float weightlessly around the shoe's midsole, creating a sense of levitation and advanced technology. The background is a clean, out-of-focus gradient of charcoal grey and deep Brooks blue.\n\n**Composition & Viewpoint:** A dramatic, low-angle side profile shot, looking slightly up at the shoe to give it a heroic presence. The shoe is placed on the right following the rule of thirds, angled diagonally towards the upper left to create a strong dynamic line. The floating spheres create leading lines that guide the viewer’s eye directly to the midsole.\n\n**Lighting & Color:** The scene is lit with a single, warm, directional light source from the side, simulating a \"golden hour\" studio setup. This light rakes across the shoe's surface, casting long, soft shadows and creating brilliant highlights that meticulously define the sculpted shape of the **DNA Tuned midsole**. The shoe features a modern colourway of deep navy blue, white, and a vibrant orange accent. The overall color palette is sophisticated and harmonious: deep blue, charcoal grey, warm gold, and crisp white.\n\n**Camera & Detail:** Shot with a 100mm macro lens at a wide aperture (f/2.8) for an extremely shallow depth of field. The focus is tack-sharp on the intricate, porous texture of the **Engineered Double Jacquard Knit Upper**, showing every individual thread with hyper-realistic clarity. The rest of the scene, including the floating spheres and the background, melts into a soft, beautiful bokeh. There is no motion blur; the image is perfectly still and crisp.\n\n**Branding:** In the upper left negative space, the word **BROOKS** is typeset cleanly above the tagline **THE ALL-NEW GLYCERIN 22**. The typography is a modern, bold, white sans-serif font. The Brooks chevron logo is subtly visible on the shoe itself but is not the primary branding element.\n\n**Negative Prompt:**\ndeformed shoe, distorted anatomy, warped proportions, text errors, rival brand logos, blurry product, low-resolution artifacts, cluttered background, harsh lighting.",

      "prompt": "**Image Generation Prompt:**\n\n**Subject:** A conceptual, tech-infused editorial shot of the Brooks Glycerin 22 running shoe. The scene is set in a minimalist, futuristic design lab during the golden hour. One single Glycerin 22 shoe (in a vibrant blue and orange colorway) rests on a sleek, dark metallic workbench. The shoe is angled in a three-quarters view, positioned on the right side of the frame following the rule of thirds.\n\n**Atmosphere & Concept:** The atmosphere is modern, intelligent, and innovative. Emanating from a hidden projector, a luminous, semi-transparent blue holographic wireframe of the shoe’s components floats in the air around the physical shoe. The primary focus of the hologram is a magnified, glowing cross-section of the DNA Tuned Cushioning midsole, clearly visualising the nitrogen-infused dual-size cell foam structure as an intricate, geometric network. The physical shoe itself is pristine and heroic.\n\n**Composition & Viewpoint:** Low-angle shot, creating a powerful and empowering perspective. A strong diagonal line leads the eye from the holographic midsole diagram in the lower-left foreground to the sharp, tangible shoe in the mid-ground right. The background is a clean, out-of-focus studio environment with a large window. A subtle Brooks chevron logo is barely visible on a blurred screen in the deep background.\n\n**Lighting:** Dramatic dual-lighting. Warm, directional light from the golden hour sun streams in from the right, catching the sculpted lines of the physical shoe and highlighting the texture of the engineered double jacquard knit upper. This contrasts with the cool, blue-white emissive light from the holographic elements, which casts a soft, technical glow onto the workbench surface.\n\n**Camera & Technical Details:** Photorealistic render. Shot as if with a 50mm prime lens at a shallow aperture (f/2.2). The texture of the midsole and the knit upper of the physical shoe are in hyper-sharp focus, while the foreground hologram and background are softly blurred (bokeh). There is no motion blur.\n\n**Colour Palette:** Dominated by deep greys and the shoe's specific blue and orange hues, accented by warm golden yellows from the sun and the cool, electric blue of the hologram.\n\n**Typography:** In the upper left quadrant, using the negative space of the blurred background, overlay the brand name \"BROOKS\" in a clean, bold, white sans-serif font. Below it, in a smaller, lighter-weight version of the same font, add the tagline \"THE ALL-NEW GLYCERIN 22\".\n\n**Negative Prompt:**\nno people, no runner, no feet, rival logos, text errors, distorted shoe proportions, warped text, ugly, blurry main subject, low-resolution, plastic-looking, poor lighting, cluttered background, multiple shoes.",
